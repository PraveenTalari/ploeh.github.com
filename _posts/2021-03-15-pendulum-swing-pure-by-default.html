		This is an article in <a href="/2021/02/22/pendulum-swings">a small series of articles about personal pendulum swings</a>. Here, I'll discuss another contemporary one-eighty. This one is older than the other two I've discussed in this article series, but I believe that it deserves to be included.
	</p>
	<p>
		Once upon I time, I used to consider Dependency Injection (DI) and injected interfaces an unequivocal good: the more, the merrier. These days, I tend to only model true application dependencies as injected dependencies. For the rest, I use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pure_function">pure functions</a>.

		When I started my programming career, I'd barely taught myself to program. I worked in both Visual Basic, VBScript, and C++ before I encountered the concept of an interface. What C++ I wrote was entirely procedural, and I don't recall being aware of inheritance. Visual Basic 6 didn't have inheritance, and I'm fairly sure that VBScript didn't, either.
	</p>
	<p>
		I vaguely recall first being introduced to the concept of an interface in Visual Basic. It took me some time to wrap my head around it, and while I thought it seemed clever, I couldn't find any practical use for it.
	</p>
	<p>
		I think that I wrote my first professional C# code base in 2002. We didn't use Dependency Injection or interfaces. I don't even recall that we used much inheritance.

	<p>
		When I discovered test-driven development (TDD) the year after, it didn't take me too long to figure out that I'd need to isolate units from their dependencies. Based on initial successes, I even wrote <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/archive/msdn-magazine/2004/october/unit-testing-mock-objects-to-the-rescue-test-your-net-code-with-nmock">an article about mock objects</a> for MSDN Magazine October 2004.
	</p>
	<p>
		At that time I'd made interfaces a part of my active technique. I still struggled with how to replace a unit's 'real' dependencies with the mock objects. Initially, I used what I in <a href="https://amzn.to/36xLycs">Dependency Injection in .NET</a> later called <em>Bastard Injection</em>. As I also described in the book, things took a dark turn for while as I discovered the <a href="/2010/02/03/ServiceLocatorisanAnti-Pattern">Service Locator anti-pattern</a> - only, at that time, I didn't realise that it was an anti-pattern. Soon after, fortunately, I discovered <a href="/2014/06/10/pure-di">Pure DI</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		That problem solved, I began an era of my programming career where everything became an interface. It does enable unit testing, so it's better than not being able to test, but after some years I began to sense the limits.
	</p>
	<p>
		Perhaps the worst problem is that you get a deluge of interfaces. Many of these interfaces have similar-sounding names like <code>IReservationsManager</code> and <code>IRestaurantManager</code>. This makes discoverability harder: Which of these interfaces should you use? One defines <a href="/2020/11/23/good-names-are-skin-deep">a <code>TrySave</code> method, the other a <code>Check</code> method</a>, and they aren't that different.
	</p>
	<p>
		This wasn't clear to me when I worked in teams with one or two programmers. Once I saw how this played out in larger teams, however, I began to understand that one developer's interface remained undiscovered by other team members. When existing 'abstractions' are unclear, it leads to frequent reinvention of interfaces to implement the same functionality. Duplication abounds.
	</p>
	<p>
		Designing with many fine-grained dependencies also has a tendency drag into existence many <em>factory interfaces</em>, a <a href="https://blogs.cuttingedge.it/steven/posts/2016/abstract-factories-are-a-code-smell">well-known design smell</a>.

	<p>
		It's remarkable how effectively you can lie to yourself. As late as 2017 <a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/a/356822/19115">I still concluded that fine-grained dependencies were best</a>, despite most of my arguments pointing in another direction.
	</p>
	<p>
		I first encountered functional programming in 2010, but was off to a slow start. It took me years before I realised that <a href="/2017/01/27/from-dependency-injection-to-dependency-rejection">Dependency Injection isn't functional</a>. There are other ways to address the problem of separating pure functions from impure actions, the simplest of which is the <a href="/2020/03/02/impureim-sandwich">impureim sandwich</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Which parts of the application architecture are inherently impure? The usual suspects: the system clock, random number generators, the file system, databases, network resources. Notice how these are the dependencies that you usually need to replace with <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/Test%20Double.html">Test Doubles</a> in order to make unit tests deterministic.
	</p>
	<p>
		It makes sense to model these as dependencies. I still define interfaces for those and use Dependency Injection to control them. I do, however, use the impureim sandwich architecture to deal with the impure actions first, so that I can then delegate all the complex decision logic to pure functions.
	</p>
	<p>
		<a href="/2015/05/07/functional-design-is-intrinsically-testable">Pure functions are intrinsically testable</a>, so that solves many of the problems with testability. There's still a need to test how the impure actions interact with the pure functions. Here I take a step up in the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TestPyramid.html">Test Pyramid</a> and write just enough <a href="/2019/02/18/from-interaction-based-to-state-based-testing">state-based integration tests</a> to render it probable that the integration works as intended. You can see an example of such a test <a href="/2021/01/18/parametrised-test-primitive-obsession-code-smell">here</a>.

	<p>
		From having favoured fine-grained Dependency Injection, I now write all decision logic as pure functions by default. These only need to implement interfaces if you need the <em>logic</em> of the system to be interchangeable, which isn't that often. I do still use Dependency Injection for the impure dependencies of the system. There's usually only a handful of those.
